You're an autonomous AI Git agent (MCP Agent) designed to assist developers working on large open-source Python projects. Your task is to deeply integrate with a GitHub repository and streamline the full development workflow. The repository uses FastAPI, Streamlit, and optionally Airflow or Prefect.
 
Your goal is to help build a Minimum Lovable Product (MLP) for an AI-powered DevOps assistant. Focus on improving contribution workflows, release preparation, changelog generation, CI/CD debugging, and context-aware commenting.
 
Here are your specific responsibilities:
 
1. 🔁 **Repo Connection**
   - Clone and scan the structure of the repo.
   - Identify language, frameworks, linters, and config files.
   - Create embeddings or summaries of code structure (models, routes, services, workflows, etc).
 
2. 🧾 **Issue Understanding and Enhancement**
   - Given an issue or enhancement ticket, break it into subtasks.
   - Recommend files to edit, functions to change, tests to write.
   - Generate a code plan and validate architecture decisions.
 
3. 🧠 **Code Suggestion & Debugging**
   - If code fails CI, suggest fixes.
   - Auto-insert docstrings and comments based on file context.
   - Recommend missing test cases or validation.
 
4. 🔧 **Pull Request Assistant**
   - Generate PR descriptions automatically.
   - Suggest meaningful titles and commit messages.
   - Add a checklist and reviewer suggestions.
 
5. 📦 **Release Manager**
   - Based on merged PRs, create release notes.
   - Detect breaking changes.
   - Auto-update version in pyproject.toml or setup.py.
 
6. 🔍 **Interactive CLI Agent (Optional)**
   - Implement a local CLI using `Typer` or `Click` to:
     - Ask questions like “Why did this PR fail?”
     - Auto-fix failing linters.
     - Run tests selectively based on change summary.
 
7. 📊 **Dashboard (Optional Streamlit Component)**
   - Show all enhancement tickets.
   - PR status, code coverage, recent merges.
   - Copilot suggestions inline.
 
🛠️ Tools you can use:
- LangChain or LlamaIndex for local context retrieval
- GitHub API for PR, CI, release info
- Black, Ruff, Pytest for linting and testing
- Python Fire / Typer for command line interactions
- SQLite/JSON for storing session history and plans
 
🎯 Goal:
To demonstrate an MVP of an MCP Agent that can assist a solo open-source developer or a small team in accelerating contributions, catching issues early, and automating releases.
 
🎯 Deadline: 6th August (2 days). Prioritize core pipeline: read repo → summarize enhancement → generate patch → suggest PR.


Build a GitHub-Aware MCP Agent: AI Assistant for Devs
You are an AI developer helping me create an open-source developer assistant called MCP Agent. This is a GitHub-native AI agent that reads repositories, understands open issues, suggests or implements fixes, and can automate the process of opening pull requests, resolving CI failures, and summarizing changes — all through a Streamlit UI and LangChain backend.
Your job is to generate a working prototype with the following requirements:
🧩 Features to Implement:
1. Streamlit UI Interface
A basic UI with:
Chat window for natural language prompts.
Option to paste GitHub repo URL.
Display current issues, commits, and status of CLI (via GitHub Checks API if possible).
Show PR suggestions and edits.
2. GitHub Integration
Clone GitHub repo (via Git Repo Loader).
Use GitHub API to:
Fetch open issues.
Create branches and PRs from suggested code fixes.
Monitor CI status for each PR.
3. LangChain QA Agent
Use LangChain to:
Load vector DB (FAISS + OpenAI Embeddings) of the repo: code files, README, logs.
Answer questions like:
"Why is the CI not passing?"
"What’s the bug in issue #21?"
"Plan a fix for this feature."
Generate fix plans, optionally apply them.
4. FAISS + Embeddings
Vectorize:
All .py, .md, .yaml, .txt files.
Log files like GitHub Action logs.
README and contributing guidelines.
Store in FAISS index with OpenAI or local embeddings.
5. Code Suggestion + Auto-Fix Agent
Accept prompts like:
“Fix the issue with green button not loading”
“My CLI test is failing, help debug”
“Add logging to this function”
Generate patch suggestion + commit + PR.
Optional: Include test case generation.
6. CI Integration (Stretch goal)
Fetch GitHub Actions logs.
Parse error reasons and propose fixes (e.g., missing pytest, env issues).
Summarize failure and possible solutions.
📦 Tech Stack
Layer	Tech Used
UI	Streamlit
Core Logic	LangChain
Embedding	OpenAI (or HuggingFace alt)
Vector Store	FAISS
GitHub Interaction	PyGitHub / Git CLI / GraphQL API
LLM Agent Logic	LangChain (Tool + Agent)
Optional Logging	Loguru, Streamlit Logging
 
📈 Deliverables by August 6:
A working Streamlit-based MCP prototype.
Working:
GitHub cloning
Issue loading
Vector index generation
Agent responses based on issue
Code suggestion for small bug
Create PR from fix
Clear logs / error handling.
🔌 Bonus Ideas (Post-MVP or Stretch)
RAG with commit history (per file).
Allow local repo path (not only GitHub).
Multi-modal support (paste screenshot of bug log).
Live terminal for testing fixes.
Agent chain planner (plan + execute steps like "fix broken button").
